# E-commerce_Data_Analysis
This project is based on Udemy ADVANCED MYSQL Data Analysis course.
 In this course, I learned how to use MySQL:
- To understand how customers access and interact with the website, 
- Analyze landing page performance and conversion,
- Cross channel Bid optimization
- Analyze Business patterns and seasonality
- Explore product-level sales.
